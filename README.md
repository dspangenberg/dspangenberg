### Hi there 👋

<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@daspbn"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mastodon/mastodon/main/app/javascript/images/logo.svg" width="16" height="16"></a>

Since my youth, I have been fascinated by programming, the beauty of logic, the need to explore unconventional solutions, and working in an analytical and solution-oriented way. The creative aspect, the need to be able to put myself in the users' shoes, and the unforeseeable, which forces me to leave the beaten track and find new solutions, made the job for nearly 30 years exciting.

After several years of developing full-stack in JavaScript (Adonis JS, Vue.js), I am currently dusting off my PHP and Laravel knowledge.

Following a long time as a freelancer, I am looking for exciting projects or for permanent employment in the SaaS in the Cologne/Bonn metropolitan area.
