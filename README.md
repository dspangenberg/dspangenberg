### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@daspbn"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mastodon/mastodon/main/app/javascript/images/logo.svg" width="16" height="16"></a>

After several years of developing full-stack in JavaScript (AdonisJS, Vue.js), I am currently dusting off my PHP and  Laravel knowledge.
Following a longtime as freelancer, I am looking for a new job (permanent employment) in the Cologne/Bonn metropolitan areaÂ (preferably as part of a small team).
